## Building from Source

## History

This project was first created House-San, who decided to hire a bunch of lawyers and piss off people because FUCK HUMANS !!!

He was very sucessful in doing so, getting lottas money in the process.

The lawyers were very happy, Legal eagle also was :

he could finally buy his own yacht while wearing indochino.


Get your own indochina with Uyghur labour at https://legaleagle.link/mackweldon and get 20% off your first purcharse !


Anyway, apparently i think they sold video games too, i think...

But most of the money was earned through lawsuits. Yum, tasty lawsuits.

So yeah a bunch of doods decide that they should revive this really obscure game about MS13.

Because MS13 are besties and very nice to people uwu

House-San loves MS13, he made several games about them and numerous love letters. ;ooo

They really love MS13 \o/

But yeah due to the Ching-Chong Virus, the project was finally complete !

That means that you can finally worship MS13 from your own room !

But stoopid white lawyers want to have MS13 for themselves !

How dare they, i don't have to pay up actual money to worship MS13, WHAT THE HELL !!!

But The-Company-whose-name-should-not-be-pronounced, said that yes :

the laws of the universe decided that MS13 was under their own copyright and 

that you cannot touch them without their own explicit permission.

WHY DOES THE 1ST AMENDMENT DONT DO SHIT AGAINST COPYRIGHT !!!

WHY COPYRIGHT LAWS OVERRIDE THE 1ST AMENDMENT !!!

BULLSHIT!!!! >>>>:((((

So yes unfortunately, if you love MS13, you can't do it from your own room :

you gotta actually get up from your bed you fucking moron and beat up some MS13 members

down the streets and get yourself killed.

Because after all, reality is the best way to experience the game.


BUT !!!

If you want to teach those nasty, evil LaWWWWyyeeerrs a lesson :

you can spread the word by copying this, show the middle finger

to lawyers while singing the American National Anthem.


Don't forget to have your taco bell or Big mac on one hand...

and a gun on the other.

## License

You can do whatever you want with it, except if you are a lawyer.
Yes, you, lawyer. You cannot put your greasly hands on it.
The license says so, it's black magic. You can't touch that shit !
The license also states that you should try gay sex if you haven't done so already.

RESPECT MY WISHES !!!!

If you still refuse to do so, please forward your complaints to :
